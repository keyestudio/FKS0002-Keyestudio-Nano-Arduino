This expansion board is compatible with Keyestudio Nano Plus development board and Keyestudio ESP32 development board. The voltage on VCC can be set to 3.3V (ESP32) or 5V(Nano) via a DIP switch.

On the board, multiple modules and sensors are integrated. They are four buttons, four LED(red, yellow, green, blue), six WS2812 RGB LED, a buzzer, a PIR motion sensor, a IR receive sensor, a sound sensor, a photoresistor, an 8002 amplifier, a potentiometer, an ultrasonic sensor, a 4-bit digital tube display, an 8x8 dot matrix display and an LCD 1602 display. 

For an easy wiring and to avoid a wrong-wiring-caused burnout, external VCC and GND are not required for all these modules and sensors. What's more, each pin possesses its own VCC and GND, which brings a higher compatibility to the board and provides more opportunities for extended learning of other modules.
